## Overview

This repository contains a **Puppeteer** script that automates login and interactions on **LeetCode** using the **Stealth Plugin** to evade detection. It logs in with a specified username and password, navigates to a submission page, and simulates user actions like clicking and keyboard input.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Bypasses detection using Puppeteer Extra's stealth plugin.
- **Automated Login**: Logs in automatically to your LeetCode account.
- **Realistic User Actions**: Simulates typing, clicking, and keyboard actions with delay.
- **Headless Browsing**: Operates in headless mode for efficiency.
- **Multiple Page Navigation**: Interacts with multiple LeetCode pages and automates actions.
